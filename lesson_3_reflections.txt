When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 I would like to do it when I need to save my work on the cloud or I will work with other persons. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-todate with your remote repository?

Because bayme some changes med in the romote location can make a conflict with the code that i am working on. So it is better that if I have finished something I could pull that code.y
