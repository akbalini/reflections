When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 I would like to do it when I need to save my work on the cloud or I will work with other persons. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-todate with your remote repository?

Because bayme some changes med in the romote location can make a conflict with the code that i am working on. So it is better that if I have finished something I could pull that code.y

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is when you want to copy a repository in github to your own account and you wont affect the original repository in case of a commit.

Clones is done when you wan to clone something in your local and you could be able to push some code if you have the rights.

Branches is when you want to create a  new feature or you just want to work in a experiment based in a commit that you have done before.
