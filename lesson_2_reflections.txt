What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates a .git to configure the repository with the correct metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different because her we store only the files to be commited. 
So It creates the opportunity to have chose the files that we want to commit and leave the ones that we still dont want on the repository.
